A Pathfinding Maze which lets users choose dimensions of desired grid and colours. The goal of the game is to reach the bottom right square in the fewest moves possible. Maze gets more difficult with the increase in grid size. If player is stuck and can't navigate to the end of the maze, they can let the computer solve it.
